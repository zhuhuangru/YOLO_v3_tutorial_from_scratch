# YOLO_v3_tutorial_from_scratch
Accompanying code for Paperspace tutorial series ["How to Implement YOLO v3 Object Detector from Scratch"](https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/)

Here's what a typical output of the detector will look like ;)

## About the training Code

This code is only mean't as a companion to the tutorial series and won't be updated. If you want to have a look at the ever updating YOLO v3 code, go to my other repo at https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/pytorch-yolo-v3

Also, the other repo offers a lot of customisation options, which are not present in this repo for making tutorial easier to follow. (Don't wanna confuse the shit out readers, do we?)

About when is the training code coming? I have my undergraduate thesis this May, and will be busy. So, you might have to wait for a till the second part of May. 

Cheers

## 关于本项目
感谢原项目的作者和诸多贡献者。 本项目是在原先作者的基础上进行中文注释的新项目，**没有修改任何实质代码**旨在对YOLO v3推断算法的全面解析，代码量不是非常大，有基础的可以在1周内完全掌握。项目不断更新中。
